simpleserver3.py is a simple client server implementation for testing AJAX messages.
The server is written in Python 3, and you need to install Python to run it.
Original source for the server: https://github.com/karthikp-ubc/CPEN400A-codesamples/blob/master/lecture6/server/
from course CPEN400A given by Karthik Pattabiraman, Electrical and Computer Engineering Department @ The University of British Columbia

You can modify the server parameters by changing the corresponding variables in the Python file
The variable names are self-explanatory. Use this to test the error-handling and timeout
functions in your AJAX requests. 

Launching the server using Python3:
python simpleserver.py
or
python3 simpleserver.py

You'll see a message like "Starting Server on Port 8080" (you can change the port no.).

To connect to the server in your web browser, type "http://localhost:8080/index.html"

If you want to contribute code to the server to make it easier to configure, please do so.
